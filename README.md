# Testrepo
This is a test repository for VG101 lab2
# Optional Assignment
One of the repositories I am interested in on GitHub is "manim" by Grant Sanderson, which is described as "animation engine for explanatory math videos". And as we all know, 3b1b's math videos have 
- great intuitive visualization 
- understanding-helpful animation

And this repository helps that.
